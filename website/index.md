## Overview

Welcome to the Grace programming language. This web page was designed to provide a comprehensive overview of 
Grace and all of its accompanying documentation. 

## Using Grace 

Using Grace could not be easier. If you're just beginning programming, checkout [**our tutorial**]({{site.baseurl}}/introduction/grace/).
Otherwise, if you have more experience, you can get started with the [web-based editor](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~grace/ide/). 

## What Grace Is 

Grace is a language that was designed specifically to make it easier for new programmers to learn to program.

                    <h4>Teaching</h4>
                    <p> Grace incorporates many recent programming language advances to make your programs shorter and simpler.  However, it is still
                    quite powerful enough to write "real" programs â€” for example, the Grace implementation is itself written in Grace.  Grace leaves out a lot of the boilerplate that lards other languages; this  makes it easier for new students to focus on the essentials of programming.</p>
                    <p>Grace also allows instructors to write _dialects_, which are variants of Grace with sepcific teaching objectives.                      For example, there is a _logo_ dialect for turtle graphics, and a _minitest_ dialect for introducing test-driven programming.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-two">
                     <h4>Design</h4>
                     <p>Grace was designed as an object-oriented language, but with significant "functional" and "procedural" sub-components.                     Dialects allow instructors to both add and remove features. In this way, Grace accommodates many different teaching styles. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-three">
                     <h4>Functionality</h4>
                     <p> Grace is a full-object-based langauge, and also includes some features that are not object-based, such as pattern matching.
                     This enables instructors to compare various progarmming styles without leaving the language.</p>
                     <p> Grace has an object-oriented type system, but its use is optional.  Variables and methods that are not annotated with types are
                     assumed to have type `Unknown`, and are not checked.  At the instructor's discretion, dialects can be used to require type annotations.

                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-four">
                     <h4>Other</h4>
                     <p>Grace has been described in [several technical papers](http://gracelang.org/applications/articles-projects/publications-about-grace/) presented at international programming conferences.  The website for discussing Grace's design is [gracelang.org](http://gracelang.org).</p>
