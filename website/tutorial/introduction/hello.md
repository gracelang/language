Traditionally, programming tutorials start with a program that displays
the text string "Hello, world!".  This is a semi-humerous way of having 
the computer say that its here.

In Grace, the "Hello, world" program looks like this.
```
print "Hello, World!"
```
Try the following program (by clicking the `Go` button).
Change the program to make it print 
something else, and try running it again.
