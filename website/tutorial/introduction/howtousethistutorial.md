Welcome to the tutorial! We're happy that you want to learn more about how to use 
Grace and the general aspects of coding. Here are some tips on using this tutorial:   
    
 - Click through the tabs on the right, top to bottom, to learn about Grace in an order that makes sense.
   Each topic builds on the previous ones, so don't skip ahead (unless you already know the material being covered).   
 - On each page, run the example! Then try to modify it to make it do something different with the coding 
   construct being covered on the page.   
 - However, note that **your work on each page of this tutorial will not be saved!** If you want to write a program in Grace 
   where your work can be preserved, use [the grace web editor](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~grace/ide/index.html). 
   Your work **there** will be saved automatically!
