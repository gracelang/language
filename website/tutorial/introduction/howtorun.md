Grace has a [web-based editor](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~grace/ide/index.html)
that works in all modern browsers, but works best in Chrome and Firefox.  
Here is information on [how to use it](../../IDE/introduction).

If you're familiar with Unix, Grace can also be run from the command-line,
but we'll leave the details for a future iteration of this page.

Finally, you can run Grace programs on this website!  You won't be able to save
them, but feel free to edit any of the code examples within these pages.
<object id="example-1" data="{{site.editor}}" width="100%" height="550px"> </object>
