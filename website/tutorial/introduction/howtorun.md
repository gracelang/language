Grace has a [web-based editor](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~grace/ide/index.html) 
that works in all modern browsers.  

If you're familiar with UNIX, Grace can also be run from the command-line,
but we'll tell you how to do that in a future iteration of this page.

Finally, you can run Grace programs on this website!  You won't be able to save
them, but feel free to edit any and all of the code examples within these pages.
