**Do** is a method associated with **list** objects that iterates over every element  
of the list and executes some action. Here is the format:  

```
list.do { element ->
  action
}
```

For those of you familiar with other languages, the **do** method acts as a **for loop**.  
Although Grace also has for loops, do statements are much more concise.

<object id="example-1" data="{{site.editor}}?do" width="100%" height="550px"> </object>
