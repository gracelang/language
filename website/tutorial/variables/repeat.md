Out of all of the loops in Grace, repeat statements are the most  
straight-forward. Repeats allow you to repeat a block of code a given  
number of times. For example:

```
repeat 5 times {
  print "This will happen five times."
}
```

<object id="example-1" data="{{site.baseurl}}/embedded-web-editor/?repeat" width="100%" height="550px"> </object>
