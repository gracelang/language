A **block** of code is a section of code encased by a leading `{` and closing `}`.  
Looking back at our **if statement** example, there were two blocks of code, one  
following the `then` and one following the `else`.

```
if (temperature > 68) then {
    print "Go jogging!"
} else {
    print "Play cards instead."
}
```

<object id="example-1" data="{{site.editor}}?block" width="100%" height="550px"> </object>
