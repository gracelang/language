### lifecycle tags for issues

We need to tag issues to show where they are up to and to manage what we look at or discuss.

Priority tags:
 - now -- should be disussed i.e. in the next week
 - soon -- should be discussed i.e. in the current release (1-2 months)
 - later -- proposed to be postponed to a later release.  When we agree to postpone, close the issue, leave it tagged laer.
 - abandoned -- abandoned. Close the issue. 
  
Status tags: 
   - resolved: to be specced - when we agree on an issue, tag it with this. 
   - drafted in spec - when drafted, remvoe resolved and tag with this. Make sure to put a link to the spec into the issue
   - done in spec - when we've agreed on the wording in the spec, removed drafted, tag done, and close the issue 

Closing issues:
  - close issues when they are either done (i.e. in the spec), abandoned, split into other issues, or sorted.
  - close issues when we agree they are postponed. Release planning should looked through closed issues tagged *later*
